[Valid anagram](https://leetcode.cn/problems/valid-anagram/) 
##### Thinking process
1. initial thoughts: for each string, store its characters and their frequencies in a hash table, return true if the two tables are equal, else return false. [unordered_map in c++ STL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unordered_map-in-cpp-stl/) Time O(n), memory O(n) 
```cpp
bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> ht1;
        unordered_map<char, int> ht2;
        for (char c: s){
            ht1[c]++;
        }
        for (char c: t){
            ht2[c]++;
        }
        return ht1 == ht2;
    }
```
2. to optimize memory usage, we can use one hash table and an integer to keep track of the difference in characters between the two string. Time O(n), memory O(n)
```cpp
 bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> ht1;
        int diff = 0;
        for (char c: s){
            ht1[c]++;
            diff++;
        }
        for (char c: t){
            ht1[c]--;
            if (ht1[c] >= 0){ // c is in s 
                diff--;
            } else {// c is not in s or this c is already redundant 
                diff++;
            }
        }
        return diff == 0;
    }
```
3. to further optimize memory, use an array of 26 integers (assume the two strings include only lowercase English letters). Traverse the first string, for each character, increase its array record by 1.  Then traverse the second string,  for each character, decrease its array entry by 1. return true if all array entries are 0, false otherwise. Time O(n), memory O(1) 
	*Can you see that an array is a hash table as well?*
```cpp
bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        int record[26] = {0};
        for (char c: s){
            record[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c: t){
            record[c - 'a']--;
        }
        for (int i: record){
            if (i) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
